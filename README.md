# Anonymise

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/anonymise`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'anonymise'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anonymise
Create `anonymise.yml` file in your local machine
Add below code to `/anonymise.yml`
```$xslt
{
  name: ["first_name","last_name","name"],
  internet: ["email","url"],
  address: ["street"]
}
```
`anonymise.yml` file will holder customer column names that need to be anonymised.
The column names are group in categories according to [Faker class names](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker#default)

## Usage
```$xslt
   $ bundle exec rake anonymise:start db:dbname path:path_to_anonymise.yml
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
